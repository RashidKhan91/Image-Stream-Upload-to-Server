# Jetpack Compose Example in Clean Architecture (MVVM) + Image-Stream-Upload-to-Server Using Xml approach.
using compose there are three pages,
1. Login page
2. recyler view aka list of items
3. detail page 

for above example we have used mocky.io to generate mock apis for data its url is 
**https://run.mocky.io/v3/408add56-7c5a-4594-ab99-ccd5fd753ae2**

after that manually by adding the main activity as launcher using can capture images 
using Camerax and then upload these image streams to server as multipart using kotlin with clean architecture.
for image uploading you can use your desired url.
